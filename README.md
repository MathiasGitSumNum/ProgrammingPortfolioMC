My professional Portfolio for my college programming classes and more.

**CS 255 System Analysis and Design:**

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a program that was intended to improve driving education by providing learning resources in paid packages, and also provide hands on training. This system was designed to operate online and collect data to help the students trying to improve their driving and pass their drivers test.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I created my diagrams well, as it helped me better understand the concepts behind them in a visual way.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose my UML sequence diagram to revise because I think it doesn't look that good visually but also I think I could have been more clear on what each group is doing in the process.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Considering the user's needs helped me when making design decisions from the beginning. If I hadn't considered the users specific needs the diagrams may have been to broad to be useful for the proposed problem.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approached designing software with the iterative approach, taking each aspect step by step. I worried less about specific details, rather focusing on the design parts as a whole and saving the details for after I decide each part is correct.

**CS 305 Software Security**

Artemis Financial is a financial firm looking to create financial services for their clients, where they can choosedifferent plans based on their needs. They are also looking to incorporate security measures that ensure the information being transferred is secured, and there is no unauthorized access occuring. Therefore the code must be written securely because it provides less chances to have weakness' that allow for hackers to by pass security. Software security adds credibility to a company's overall wellbeing. One thing I think could be improved is the dependency checks and suppression of false positives, in order to further improve the security measures.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Please review the document titled "CS305ProjectTwo_MattCarrillo". This is the Practices for Secure Software Report.

**CS 330 Comp Graphics and Visualisation**

**UNABLE TO UPLOAD 3D SCENE FILE, IT IS TOO LARGE FOR GITHUB**

How do I approach designing software?

When designing software I approach the project iteratively. After reviewing all of the requirements, I look at each part and make sure to complete what is absolutely necessary, and then work on specific details later once everything is established. This approach helped make things easier for me when solving problems that arise.
  
How do I approach developing programs?

When actually creating the software, I do things essentially the same way. I start with a very basic program that meets the base necessary requirements, and then add more after to flesh out the project and meet more detailed requirements. 
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer Science helps me reach my goals by being the basis for my career goal of Videogame development. I dream of being part of a team that creates something that others enjoy to play and talk about. Understanding the concepts of this cource, even if it's not what I want to do on a development team, only serves to help me in the long run.

**CS 230 Operating Platforms:**

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client is 'The Gaming Room', who are currently developing a game called 'Draw it or Lose it' for mobile devices. They were interested in improving their software functionality and expand the platforms the game operates on. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did well at formulating my thoughts and presenting a clear advisory path in the documentation. I also think I did well at explaining why I advised what I did.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

A design document inherently helps keep things organized and focused, and create a hierarchy of which tasks are the most important.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Despite my confidence in my explanations, I'm not as confidant in the recomendations themselves being the best option. I think I would review them and decide if the recommendation was the best and justify the explanations I made.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Essentially the functionality was seperated into parts in order to lessen the amount of time spent on expanding to other platforms. It's important to consider the users needs while designing the software because the developers can better avoid major issues with the product and ensure the the client will actually use the product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I focus in on making documentation clear and consistent, as well as developing in a way that makes updates and maintanence easier (In theory). I will keep this process for myself in the future, unless there is a specific situation where I need to deviate from it.

**CS 320 Software Test, Automation QA:**

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to do that is to run and debug the code often and utilize unit tests effectively. If there are no failures, then I can move on to making the working code more secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are essentially a developers "General Guideline", where it can be loosely followed while incorporating standardized practices. Communication must be maintained in order to adapt to any changes or additional needs. This helps ensure that the final product funtions as intended, and that the client is satisfied.

How do I approach designing software?

Stay up to date on current best practice guidlines. It's also important to think about if the current way of doing things is truly working the best it can, or if something different would work better.

**CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle:**

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting any users needs will usually start by analizing the system being used.
This can be done by asking the users for feedback on their experiences with the program, or asking team members if they found any errors or necessary changes within the code.
Inputs and outputs should also be identified as well, by utilizing user stories for gathering this information. User Stories are where the users can express their needs and wants for the program. 
Interpreting the provided user stories will help with understanding the end users perspectives.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The Waterfall Method is a valid approach which helps in projecting the needs of a specific strategy and work flow. However, because it is very specific and rigid, 
it is difficult to incorporate changes in the waterfall method.
Another more common method is Agile, which generally offers more flexibility and it is a unique way to work with testing, planning and client integration.
Agile is usually the industry standard, so incorporating it into future projects shouldn't be much of a consideration for me, as the teams I join will already be using the Agile Method.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think being a good team member means to make sure you are thouroughly understanding your part of the project and making sure you are not lagging behind, which will make the team fall behind. 
I also think being a good team member means to listen to co-workers and cooperate well. Good team members should also be willing to help anyone on the team who may need it.

**CS 210 Programming Languages:**

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

I choose to submit the Project 2 Banking program from Module 5. The program is an investment calculator, where it asks the user for relevant information such as the initial investment amount, how much they will invest per month for how many years, and the annual interest percentage and then calculates the monetary total amount in the account for each year.

What did you do particularly well?

I'm very happy with the clean formatting of the information in the menu(s), as well as I think I handled the calculations well in the code.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think this code could be enhanced by only showing the year the user requested rather than dumping all the data at once. There could then be another prompt for the user to find data for a specific year if they need it. There could also be an option to write the data to txt file, so that the user can easily access the information at a later date without having to re-run the program. I think changes like these would make the program more efficient and useful for the user to use regularly.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The calculations were the most difficult to write, because I struggled at first having thing display correctly or at all. I then had to double check the math to make sure It was calculating the input correctly (For example, if I didn't initially follow pemdas I would end up with different results).

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The best practices of programming is utilized and easily transferable from this project to the next. I also think the proper use of a .h file is great to keep in mind and possibly use in future projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Commenting important information in the code helped with making the code maintainable and readable. It was easy to find and remember what specific parts of the code were doing with identifier comments and descriptive comments for fixing errors. This also made it so that the code could be understood and adapted by someone else.

**CS 340 Client/Server Development:**

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Programs are created with all of these aspects by thuroughly considering each use case of the program. When the program is easy to comprehend and adaptable, it makes the program easier to maintain and better for future uses. With the CRUD module, it can be easily expanded and used in future MongoDB Projects.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach computer science problems with a logical plan and an analytical approach. For the project, I made an effort to fully understand and make design decisions based on the requirements before touching any code. This differed from previous modules as I had to understand everything I could before starting rather than taking things step by step. In the future where I potentially need what I learned from this course I will generally know how to implement creation and aggregation of data methods for a clients benefit.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist engineer and develop computer-based solutions to streamline processes in the work environment. This matters for said work environment because data can be processed quicker than before and improve productivity with the aid of computer hardware. My own work on this project helps the company by providing relevant information in the database in an organized manner, saving them work time trying to find the information manualy.

**CS 370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS**

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

A large portion of the code was provided, but I did write the code within the main loop of the application that allowed the agent to decide its movements and what was the most efficient path.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, develop and analyze both software and hardware used in computer systems to solve problems in many different industries. This matters as it serves to improve and advance the way all professional fields operate.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I try to understand each step I need to take in order to acomplish a given task. Then I analyze what is done well in my solution and what I can improve upon, or if something has to be changed to meet a certain requirement. This method does not always work, as sometimes there is no steps to follow, or the end goal is not clear. However, I believe this is the best process to work through most computer science problems.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

The ethical responsibilities to the end user are primarily relating to transperency. There is a large part of cyber security that focuses on protecting users personal information, and for those creating AI systems, what ways they can safely use that information while also avoiding biases and other ethical concerns in their system.
