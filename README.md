**CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle:**

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting any users needs will usually start by analizing the system being used.
This can be done by asking the users for feedback on their experiences with the program, or asking team members if they found any errors or necessary changes within the code.
Inputs and outputs should also be identified as well, by utilizing user stories for gathering this information. User Stories are where the users can express their needs and wants for the program. 
Interpreting the provided user stories will help with understanding the end users perspectives.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The Waterfall Method is a valid approach which helps in projecting the needs of a specific strategy and work flow. However, because it is very specific and rigid, 
it is difficult to incorporate changes in the waterfall method.
Another more common method is Agile, which generally offers more flexibility and it is a unique way to work with testing, planning and client integration.
Agile is usually the industry standard, so incorporating it into future projects shouldn't be much of a consideration for me, as the teams I join will already be using the Agile Method.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think being a good team member means to make sure you are thouroughly understanding your part of the project and making sure you are not lagging behind, which will make the team fall behind. 
I also think being a good team member means to listen to co-workers and cooperate well. Good team members should also be willing to help anyone on the team who may need it.

**CS 210 Programming Languages:**

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:



What did you do particularly well?



Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?



Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?



What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?



How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
